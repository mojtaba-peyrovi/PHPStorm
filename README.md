###PHPStorm Guide:

__Navigate:__ we can navigate by class name. ==> we can simply search for the class name and it opens it for us.
also we can navigate by method name(symbol)
- __alt+1:__  we can hide the tree view of the files on left side.
- in settings/editor/color scheme we can change the scheme.
- when we want to find much more choices of the code themes, we can go to this address:
```
https://daylerees.github.io/
```
then we choose the theme we need and then we go to :
```
https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes
```
And find the associated icls file for it.
Then we open the file and change it to raw and then copy the file and paste it in this folder:
```
C:\Users\mojiway\.PhpStorm2018.1\config\colors
```
__IMPORTANT:__  with __shift+ctrl+a__ we can search for anything and everything.
- file templates is where we can define any template and key shortcode to automate some of the coding.
(for example we make Eloquent Model)
- pressing shift 2 times, we can search for anything.

__Creating a new file/class:__ Alt+Insert


#### Live Templating:

We can convert any snippet of code, into a live template. (for codes we use a lot, we make a shortcut)

We just need to select the code, and then open __Live Template__ (we can search for it using double shift). Then select the option of __Save as a live template.__

Now we have to say what key we use to expand it. and what our abbreviation would be.

__Ctrl+j:__ opens a dialog to insert live template.


#### Reformatting the code:

If the code is disorganized, PHPStorm will fix it autmatically by pressing __Ctrl+Alt+L.__ or with shitf+shift search for __reformat code.__

- for opening settings: Ctrl+Alt+s

- In settings/live templates we can edit all live templates

- In settings/code style we can customize all spacing, braces, etc.

__Important:__ In order to run the original trait or function we use in a different class we hold Ctrl and click on the method. It opens the source file and class.

__VERY USEFUL:__ In order to make a new file:
```
1- Proess Ctrl+home
2- from the the top. where the folder structure is, find the folder you want to put the new file in
3- press Ctrl+insert , then from the dialog box choose the file type and name the file
4- create it, Done!
```

- To duplicate a line: `Ctrl + D`

- To move a line up and down: `Ctrl + Shift + arrow up/arrow down`

- To remove a line: `Ctrl + Y`
